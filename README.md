### 🎮 **Core Mechanics**
- **Aiming & Shooting**: 
  - Drag to aim, adjust the trajectory, and release to launch multiple balls.
  - Balls bounce off walls and objects before returning to the launcher.
- **Block System**:
  - Blocks have numbers representing the hits required to break them.
  - Power blocks spawn additional balls to aid gameplay.  
- **Dynamic Row Shifting**:

2. **Break Blocks**: Decrease their hit points or destroy them entirely.
3. **Shift Rows**: Watch as new rows are generated while blocks shift closer to the touchline.
4. **Survive**: Keep the blocks from reaching the touchline to avoid *Game Over*.
